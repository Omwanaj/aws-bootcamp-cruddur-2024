# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

Well, week 0 has been interesting to explore AWS CLI in Gitpod - challenging but good to learn setting up credentials in environment variables. On the backdrop of the security session by Ashish which gives overview of native ops-sec in AWS. Billing was great, considering I had a former account closed due to billing issues :)
Keen on cost management going forward. Lastly, getting back to git usage is something - am eager to refresh and learn more git-ops onwards.
